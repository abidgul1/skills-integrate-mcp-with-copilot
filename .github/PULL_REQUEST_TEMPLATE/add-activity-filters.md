### Add activity filters and search UI to activities page

This pull request adds a filter and search interface to the activities page, allowing users to:
- Search activities by name or description
- Filter activities by category (Academic, Sports, Arts, Clubs)
- Sort activities by name or availability

**Files changed:**
- src/static/index.html
- src/static/app.js

This improves navigation and usability for students and teachers when viewing and signing up for activities.
